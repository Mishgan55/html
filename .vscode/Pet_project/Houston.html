      Houston was founded by land investors on August 30, 1836, at the
      confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou (a point now known as
      Allen's Landing) and incorporated as a city on June 5, 1837. The city is
      named after former General Sam Houston, who was president of the Republic
      of Texas and had won Texas's independence from Mexico at the Battle of San
      Jacinto 25 miles (40 km) east of Allen's Landing. After briefly serving as
      the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s, Houston grew steadily
      into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century. The
      arrival of the 20th century brought a convergence of economic factors that
      fueled rapid growth in Houston, including a burgeoning port and railroad
      industry, the decline of Galveston as Texas's primary port following a
      devastating 1900 hurricane, the subsequent construction of the Houston
      Ship Channel, and the Texas oil boom. In the mid-20th century, Houston's
      economy diversified, as it became home to the Texas Medical Center—the
      world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and
      NASA's Johnson Space Center, home to the Mission Control Center. Since the
      late 19th century Houston's economy has had a broad industrial base, in
      energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. Leading in
      healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment, Houston has the
      second-most Fortune 500 headquarters of any U.S. municipality within its
      city limits (after New York City). The Port of Houston ranks first in the
      United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in
      total cargo tonnage handled. Nicknamed the "Bayou City", "Space City",
      "H-Town", and "the 713", Houston has become a global city, with strengths
      in culture, medicine, and research. The city has a population from various
      ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international
      community. Houston is the most diverse metropolitan area in Texas and has
      been described as the most racially and ethnically diverse major city in
      the U.S. It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which
      attract more than seven million visitors a year to the Museum District.
      The Museum District is home to nineteen museums, galleries, and community
      spaces. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the
      Theater District, and offers year-round resident companies in all major
      performing arts
